# Programming-Language-Reddit-Scraper
Scrapes the top 10 most frequently used words in a list of subreddits

* Author: Darren Pak
* This project was created for my CPSC-354 Final.

For the final project, I analyzed the top 10 most popular programming language subreddits to determine key characteristics and attributes of each language. Subreddits are communities on the social media platform “Reddit” that offer a forum for developers and users alike to discuss various topics. Each subreddit is focused on a specific topic, and in this case, we will take a look at the programming language subreddits to see if we can analyze discussions and find out more about the language. This project aims to provide insight into how each programming language is used, including common applications, errors and error messages, and tools and packages that are frequently used by developers.
